# 3D Finite Element Method MATLAB Design Project

Final design project for an Engineering Physics course at McMaster University. A FEM model done in 3D in MATLAB to showcase an understanding of numerical method techniques. The project is based on a problem for a course assignment from the previous year, but expanded to 3D involving the cooking of a pizza loaf. 

This project was made for the ENGPHYS 3NM4 course which required a small final project and report handed in to demonstrate an understanding of the numerical methods taught within the course.
